Image Generation with Stable Diffusion  
Prodigy InfoTech – Generative AI Internship (Task-02)

📌 Task Objective  
The objective of this task is to generate images from textual descriptions using pre-trained generative models. This task helps in understanding how text-to-image generation works and how diffusion-based models translate natural language prompts into visual outputs.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
Python  
Google Colab  
Stable Diffusion (Pre-trained Model)  
Hugging Face Diffusers  
PyTorch  

📂 Project Description  
In this project, a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model is used to generate images based on input text prompts. The prompt is processed by the model to understand the semantic meaning, and an image is generated iteratively through a diffusion process. The outputs demonstrate the capability of Generative AI models to create realistic and creative images from natural language input.

🔄 Workflow  
Install required libraries (diffusers, torch, transformers)  
Load the Stable Diffusion pre-trained model  
Provide a text prompt describing the desired image  
Generate the image using the diffusion process  
Display and save the generated image  

📝 Sample Input  
A futuristic city at sunset with flying cars  

📤 Sample Output  
An AI-generated image depicting a futuristic city environment with advanced architecture, glowing lights, and flying vehicles during sunset.

🎯 Learning Outcomes  
Understanding of text-to-image generation concepts  
Hands-on experience with diffusion-based generative models  
Knowledge of prompt-based image generation  
Practical exposure to Hugging Face Diffusers library  

🔍 Extra Showcase – Image-Generation-with-Stable-Diffusion (Web Application)  
As an additional showcase beyond the mandatory task requirements, an Image Generation Web Application was developed to demonstrate the integration of a text-to-image generative model into a web-based interface.

This showcase illustrates how a Stable Diffusion model can be connected with a backend framework and accessed through a browser UI, enabling users to input prompts and view generated images interactively.

✨ Key Highlights  
Real-time image generation through a web interface  
Backend implemented using Python and Flask  
Stable Diffusion model integrated using Hugging Face Diffusers  
Visually appealing and interactive user interface  

🧰 Technologies Used  
Python  
Flask  
Stable Diffusion (Hugging Face Diffusers)  
HTML  
CSS
